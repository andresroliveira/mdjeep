Collection of test problems for MD-jeep (from version 0.1)

Each instance has been created articially as follows:
- the PDB file related to the corresponding protein has been downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
- all backbone atoms of the protein have been extracted (including hydrogen atoms)
- all distances related to bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles have been included in the instance
- all the possible distances between pairs of hydrogen atoms have been computed,
  and distances falling in the interval [2,5] Angstroms have been considered
- the atoms have been sorted by following the discretization order published in:

  "On the Identification of Discretization Orders for Distance Geometry with Intervals",
  Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8085, F. Nielsen and F. Barbaresco (Eds.),
