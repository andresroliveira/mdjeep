Collection of test problems for MD-jeep (version 0.1)

Each instance has been created articially as follows:
- the PDB file related to the corresponding protein has been downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
- the backbone atoms N-C_{alpha}-C of the protein have been extracted
- all the possible distances between pairs of backbone atoms have been computed
- only distances smaller than 6 Angstrom have been considered
