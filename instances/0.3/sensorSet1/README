This set of instances is released with the version 0.3.2 of MDjeep

The instances are generated to resemble sensor network localization problems in 3D.

In a predefined box of the three-dimensional space, points are randomly placed and their relative distances
are computed: distances below a predefined threshold are included in the instance, all others are neglected
as far as the discretization assumptions are already satisfied (otherwise some additional distances above the
threshold are considered). Shortest distances are considered as "exact" (their lower and upper bound coincide, 
there are at least 2 per vertex with rank >= 3), all others are intervals having a range of 0.1.

The total number of vertices is randomly chosen between 50 and 150, and the number of digits used to represent
the distances is also randomly chosen, and ranging between 2 and 10.
