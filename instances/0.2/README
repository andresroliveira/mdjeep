Collection of test problems for MD-jeep (from version 0.2)

Each instance has been created articially as follows:
- the PDB file related to the corresponding protein has been downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
- all protein atoms are here considered (from the backbone and from the side chains)
- all distances related to bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles have been included in the instance
- all the possible distances between pairs of hydrogen atoms have been computed,
  and distances falling in the interval [2,5] Angstroms have been considered
- backbone atoms have been sorted by following the discretization order published in:
  A. Mucherino,
  "On the Identification of Discretization Orders for Distance Geometry with Intervals",
  Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8085, F. Nielsen and F. Barbaresco (Eds.),
  Proceedings of Geometric Science of Information (GSI13), Paris, France, 231-238, 2013.
- side chains atoms have been considered in their "natural order" (as in the PDB file)
