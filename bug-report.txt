Bug report

MDjeep 0.3.2

The method implemented in the main for the identification of triplets of reference vertices was raising a false 
warning. The warning is supposed to warn the user about the collinearity of the reference vertices. This bug
was discovered by Wagner Rocha and has been fixed in the commit "version 0.3.2 patch".

The cosomega function could have been stuck in an infinite loop in some particular conditions. This bug was
discovered by Simon Hengeveld and has been fixed in the commit "version 0.3.2 patch".

MDjeep 0.3.0

The method implemented for the computation of the boxes was giving wrong results in some particular cases. The bug was
probably not detected during the development of MDjeep 0.3.0 because SPG had just been included to "correct" a potential 
error propagation. 

The use of the bound expansion feature in SPG was allowing the generation of solutions that were not included in the
original set of boxes.

Both bugs have been fixed in MDjeep 0.3.1.
