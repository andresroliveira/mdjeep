MDjeep 0.3.2

The method implemented in the main for the identification of triplets of reference vertices was raising a false 
warning. The warning is supposed to warn the user about the collinearity of the reference vertices. This bug
was discovered by Wagner Rocha and has been fixed in the commit "version 0.3.2 patch".

The cosomega function could have been stuck in an infinite loop in some particular conditions. This bug was
discovered by Simon Hengeveld and has been fixed in the commit "version 0.3.2 patch".

The arclength in splitOmegaIntervals was not properly computed. The strategy for expanding the boxes is
probably responsable for alleviating the negative impacts of this bug. This bug was fixed in the commit
"version 0.3.2 patch 2".

Since the version 0.3.0, MDjeep attempts avoiding to generate solutions that are too close to other found
solutions. This is regulated by the resolution parameter. However, the comparisons were actually performed
too early, i.e. at tree levels where potentially the two compared solutions could still consistently diverge. 
This bug was discovered by Therese Malliavin and was fixed in the commit "version 0.3.2 patch 2".

WARNING: Fixing this very last bug made MDjeep slower in finding all solutions for certain instances.

MDjeep 0.3.0

The method implemented for the computation of the boxes was giving wrong results in some particular cases. The bug was
probably not detected during the development of MDjeep 0.3.0 because SPG had just been included to "correct" a potential 
error propagation. 

The use of the bound expansion feature in SPG was allowing the generation of solutions that were not included in the
original set of boxes.

Both bugs have been fixed in MDjeep 0.3.1.
