MDjeep 0.3.0

The method implemented for the computation of the boxes was giving wrong results in some particular cases. The bug was
probably not detected during the development of MDjeep 0.3.0 because SPG had just been included to "correct" a potential 
error propagation. 

The use of the bound expansion feature in SPG was allowing the generation of solutions that were not included in the
original set of boxes.

Both bugs have been fixed in MDjeep 0.3.1.
