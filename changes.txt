MDjeep version 0.3.*

Changes
-------

Version 0.3.1 vs 0.3.0

1. Two bugs were detected in the version 0.3.0 (see bug report).
   The method implemented for the computation of the boxes was
   giving wrong results in some particular situations: 
   MDjeep 0.3.1 implements now a more realible method for
   the computation the bound boxes.
   The second bug was related to the bound expansion feature
   of SPG, where the generation of solutions not strictly
   contained in the box bounds was possible. This mechanism
   is reimplemented in MDjeep 0.3.1 to avoid this issue.

2. The verification of the discretization assumptions is now 
   performed by using external functions (functions of C file 
   "vertex"), the functions are initialClique, isDDGP and 
   isDMDGP. For MDjeep 0.3.1 to solve the input instance, it 
   is necessary that the function isDDGP gives a positive answer; 
   if the result of isDMDGP is negative, MDjeep can still solve 
   the instance (this verification is in fact now optional, and 
   performed automatically only when the instance is composed 
   only by exact distances).

3. The verification of the existence of the symmetric vertices 
   is also now performed by an external function of the "vertex"
   C file (function findSymmetries). The new implemented method 
   has a lower complexity wrt the method implemented directly in 
   the main of version 0.3.0 (old complexity: |V|^3, new worst-case 
   complexity: |V|*|E|, where V is the instance vertex set, and E 
   is its edge set).

4. The computation of the reference vertices to be used in the BP
   algorithm is performed only once, and the triplets of reference 
   vertices are kept in memory for the several recursive calls 
   to BP. When more than one reference triplet can be selected, 
   the "optimal" one is searched (basically, when all distances 
   are exact, we avoid to select triplets leading to the definition 
   of angles close to a multiple of pi; whereas if one distance is 
   an interval, we simply take the triplet with two exact distances
   and the interval with the smallest range).

5. The resolution parameter is now disabled when stepping from 
   a symmetric side to the other of the search tree (when the 
   option "-sym" is not used). In this way, solutions obtained 
   from both symmetric parts of the search tree will be contained
   in the solution set.

6. A new pruning device, named BoxDDF, is integrated in MDjeep 0.3.1
   in order to compute the distances between pairs of boxes
   "envelopping" pairs of vertices with known distance: if the 
   available distance cannot be satisfied by the two boxes, then 
   it is not necessary to call SPG in the attempt to refine the 
   current solution (because the infeasibility cannot be removed 
   as far as the vertex positions are contained in their 
   corresponding boxes). This improvement was suggested by
   Douglas S. Goncalves.

7. In order to avoid lowering the performaces (wrt the performances
   that MDjeep 0.2 is able to give) when dealing with instances
   consisting of only exact distances, MDjeep 0.3.1 follows two
   separated paths for the solution of instances containing or 
   not interval distances. To this aim, the function bp_exact was 
   included, which is strongly inspired by the version of bp given 
   in MDjeep 0.2. Among the other differences in dealing with 
   instances containing interval distances or not, we point out 
   that  the resolution parameter is now disabled when the instance 
   at hand only contains exact distances.

8. New auxiliary functions were included in the C files "distance"
   and "utils".
