This set of instances is released with the version 0.3.0 of MDjeep

The instances have been generated as described in:

A. Mucherino, J-H. Lin, 
An Efficient Exhaustive Search for the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem with Interval Data,
to appear in IEEE Conference Proceedings, Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS19), 
Workshop on Computational Optimization (WCO19), Leipzig, Germany, September 2019. 

but by keeping every distance in high precision (about 16 decimal digits). For this reason, the results obtained with 
MDjeep 0.3.0 and those presented in the paper differ.
