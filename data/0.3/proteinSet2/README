This set of instances is released with the version 0.3.2 of MDjeep

The instances have been generated as described in:

A. Mucherino, J-H. Lin, 
An Efficient Exhaustive Search for the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem with Interval Data,
to appear in IEEE Conference Proceedings, Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS19), 
Workshop on Computational Optimization (WCO19), Leipzig, Germany, September 2019. 

The experiments presented in this paper, however, were obtained with a previous (and still experimental) version
of MDjeep 0.3.0. The results obtained with the current version and those presented in the paper may therefore differ.
