This program solves Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problems (DMDGPs).

In the current version (0.1), only instances containing exact values for the distances can be solved.

syntax: ./bp [options] instance.nmr

NMR file format: list of distances [i j iatom jatom iamino jamino l u]
  where:
* i is the label of the first atom
* j is the label of the second atom
* iatom is the name of the atom i (3 letter format)
* jatom is the name of the atom j (3 letter format)
* iamino is the amino acid where atom i is contained
* jamino is the amino acid where atom j is contained
* l is the lower bound on the distance (i,j)
* u is the upper bound on the distance (i,j)
  (in this version, l and u must be the same)

Options:
-e sets the tolerance epsilon
-p prints the best found solution in a PDB file
-P prints all the solutions in different PDB files
-s symmetric solutions are not computed
-t triangular inequalities are checked
-1 the algorithm stops at the first solution
   (when using -1, options -p and -P have the same effect)

In the following versions:
* management of instances affected by experimental errors
* management of instances with inexact distances
