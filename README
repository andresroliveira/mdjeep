MD-jeep, version 0.2
The Branch & Prune algorithm for discretizable Distance Geometry
Copyright (C) 2014, Mucherino, Liberti, Goncalves, Lavor, Maculan
GNU General Public License v.2

This program solves Molecular Distance Geometry Problems (MDGPs) that can be discretized.

In versions (0.*), only instances containing exact values for the distances can be solved.

syntax: ./mdjeep [options] instance.nmr

NMR file format: list of distances [i j iatom jatom iamino jamino l u]
  where:
* i is the label of the first atom
* j is the label of the second atom
* iatom is the name of the atom i (3 letter format)
* jatom is the name of the atom j (3 letter format)
* iamino is the amino acid where atom i is contained
* jamino is the amino acid where atom j is contained
* l is the lower bound on the distance (i,j)
* u is the upper bound on the distance (i,j)
  (in this version, l and u must be the same)

Options:
-m1 method1 used for coordinate computation (default, see below)
-m2 method2 used for coordinate computation
 -e sets the tolerance epsilon
 -p prints the best found solution in a PDB file
 -P prints all the solutions in different PDB files
 -s only one symmetric half of the tree is explored
 -t triangular inequalities are checked
 -1 the algorithm stops at the first solution
    (when using -1, options -p and -P have the same effect)

Methods for coordinate computation:

- method1
  This method is based on cumulative matrices containing the atomic coordinates.
  Details about this method can be found in
     C. Lavor, L. Liberti, N. Maculan, A. Mucherino, 
     "The Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem", 
     Computational Optimization and Applications 52, 115-146, 2012.
  This method needs the consecutivity assumption on the reference atoms to be satisfied.  

- method2
  This method is based on local coordinate systems and change of basis.
  Details about this method can be found in
     D.S. Goncalves, A. Mucherino, 
     "Discretization Orders and Efficient Computation of Cartesian Coordinates for Distance Geometry", 
     to appear in Optimization Letters, 2014.
  This method does not need the consecutivity assumption to be satisfied.

In the following versions:
* exploiting the symmetric properties of BP trees
* management of instances affected by experimental errors
* management of instances with inexact distances
